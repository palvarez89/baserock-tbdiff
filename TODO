General
-------
 + Use sizeof(var) or (type) instead of fixed byte lengths on fread/fwrite
 + Fix endian issues in case we run the generator on a different
   endianness to the deployer.
 + Separate reading/writing stream data from actual file system operation
 + Create a manifest of deleted/created/modified files
 + Improve commandline for the deploy command
 + Rename the project to trebuchet-differ (tbdiff)
 + Create autotools scripts
 + Improve function namespaces to ease understanding
 + Add copyright headers to all source files

Features
--------

 + Need to be able to embed metadata into the top of an update 
   stream e.g. arbitrary key/value pairs would be nice.
 + Need to be able to retrieve that metadata separately from deploying
   a stream, so that metadata files can be prepared on the server.
 + Ideally deploy should be able to take any stream URI (or perhaps
   stdin, allowing for curl externally?)
 + Support a given pathname changing kind.
   - That can be done by embedding a delete and then a create
