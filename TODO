General
-------

 + Make the code nicer and fit with coding style
 + Fix endian issues in case we run the generator on a different
   endianness to the deployer.

Features
--------

 + Need to be able to embed metadata into the top of an update 
   stream e.g. arbitrary key/value pairs would be nice.
 + Need to be able to retrieve that metadata separately from deploying
   a stream, so that metadata files can be prepared on the server.
 + Ideally deploy should be able to take any stream URI (or perhaps
   stdin, allowing for curl externally?)
 + Need to support:
   - Symbolic links
   - Device nodes
   - Named pipes
   - (Ignore?) Sockets
 + Support a given pathname changing kind.
   - That can be done by embedding a delete and then a create
