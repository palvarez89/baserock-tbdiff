Running the test suite
----------------------
Change to the top-level directory of the tbdiff source tree and run:

$ make check

this will run the yarns after all the old tests have passed.


If however, you would rather not sit and wait for old tests to be run,
compile 'yarns/symtime.c' using:

$ gcc symtime -o yarns/symtime.c

followed by:

$ ./yarns/run_yarns.sh

to run the yarns (note that the compiling of 'yarns/symtime.c' is not
required if `make check` has run at least once successfully).
